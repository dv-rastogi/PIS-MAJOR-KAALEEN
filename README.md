# PIS-MAJOR-KAALEEN
Kaaleen is a simple mat like device that can be placed anywhere in your house-the bottom of your cupboard, on your dressing table, on your shoe rack in the foyer, it’s up to you. Just connect it to our app and you are good to go. As soon as you put an important article of yours, that has been enhanced by using our K-Tags, the app registers that the item has been placed on the mat, thus helping you keep tabs on it. And that’s not all - using our K-Door extension, our Kaaleen ecosystem will work in tandem and send you a notification if you have forgotten to keep something in its place or have forgotten to take something important out with you.
